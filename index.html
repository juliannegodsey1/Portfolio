                     <ul class="list">
                         <li>Created a cat database model with properties such as PetID, name, age, neutered 
                            status, good with other pets status, sex, and picture URL in C#. </li>
                         <li>Developed a view model to present detailed information about each cat available 
                            for adoption.</li>
                         <li>Established a cat repository in C# with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods 
                            for managing cat data, including adding new cats, listing all available cats, updating 
                            existing cat information, and removing cats from the adoption center.</li>
                         <li>Utilized SQL commands and database connections within each CRUD method to perform 
                            operations such as inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting cat records.</li>
                            <li>Employed HTML and CSS to design view pages for displaying individual cat profiles 
                                and a comprehensive catalog of all cats available for adoption. Corresponding 
                                controllers were implemented to handle requests and responses for the view pages.</li>

                            <li>The application parses each line of the document into an array format, capturing the 
                                location name, latitude, and longitude.</li>
                            <li>Test-driven development ensures that invalid and missing data is handled correctly</li>
                            <li>If the data is out of bounds or cannot be parsed, then the parse method returns null. 
                                Otherwise, the latitude and longitude are parsed</li>
                            <li>Utilizing the parsed coordinates, the application calculates the distances between each 
                                pair in order to find the two restaurants furthest apart</li>

                             <li>Similarly, the application accesses the Ron Swanson API, converting the received JSON
